# DrupalAI Hackathon 2026

This project is based on **Drupal CMS**, a fast-moving open source product that enables site builders to create Drupal
sites with smart defaults using only their browser.

This repository serves as the official starting point for hackathon participants.

## Participation workflow

Participants must **fork this repository** into a GitHub account of their choosing.

All development must happen in the forked repository.

When ready for review, participants must open a **pull request back to this repository** so that judges can review and evaluate the submission.

## Getting started

If you want to use DDEV to run Drupal CMS locally, follow these steps:

1. Install DDEV following the documentation at [https://ddev.com/get-started/](https://ddev.com/get-started/)
2. Open a terminal and change to the root directory of this project
3. Run the following commands:

```shell
ddev start
ddev install
ddev launch
```

Drupal CMS has the same system requirements as Drupal core. You may use any supported local setup if you prefer.

See the Drupal User Guide for more information on installation options:
[https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/installation-chapter.html](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/installation-chapter.html)

## AI provider and model requirements

This distribution is configured to use an AI provider via the Drupal AI module. Participants **must use the amazee.io provider**
for all AI-powered features in their submission. Non-amazee.ai providers are not permitted unless explicitly approved by hackathon organizers.

Participants may add any Drupal modules they require for their solution.

## amazee.io AI provider setup

To configure the provider:

1. Visit the amazee.io provider configuration form at **Configuration → AI → Provider Settings → amazee.io Authentication**
   (typically `/admin/config/ai/providers/amazeeio`).
2. Enter the **email address used to register for the hackathon** to start the authentication process.
3. Check your email for a verification code from amazee.ai, enter it in the form, and submit.
4. Choose the region `Play to Impact - Drupal AI Hackathon 2026`. If you don't find it contact the organizers.
5. Once verified, the amazee.ai credentials (LLM key and VectorDB key) will be stored in the **Keys** module at
   `/admin/config/system/keys`.
6. Go to **Configuration → AI → AI Default Settings** and select at least one Mistral model at its core for the relevant operation types.

Please note that the keys generated by amazee.io are exported in clear text in the configuration.
For this reason, the related configuration has been [config-ignored](./config/sync/config_ignore.settings.yml).
As a result, when setting up the site on DevPanel, you must configure the keys again by following the instructions above.

## Configuration export requirement

Before opening a pull request, participants must export configuration using the following command:

```shell
ddev drush cex
```

The exported configuration must be committed and included in the pull request. Pull requests without exported configuration
will not be considered complete.

## DevPanel setup guide

This section describes how to set up your [DevPanel](https://console.devpanel.com/) project and development environment for the hackathon.

### 1. Setting Up an Account

Each developer can create an individual **DevPanel** account using the same email address used for the registration.

After registration, each team member must send the following to the hackathon organization:

- Email address used for registration
- Full name
- Team name / team number

**Note**: analysts do **not** need DevPanel access. They will only use the live site URL.

### 2. Forking the Source Repository on GitHub

Steps:

1. Go to the official hackathon source repository.
2. Create a **fork** under your personal GitHub account.
3. **Do not rename** the repository.

**Important**: The forked repository becomes your team’s **single source of truth**. Drupal Forge templates and environments
are disposable — GitHub is not.

### 3. Creating a Project from the Forked Repository

Steps:

1. Log in to **DevPanel**.
2. You will be redirected to the **Workspaces** page, create one.
3. Access the workspace you just created and click **+ Create project from scratch**.

Fill in the form as follows:

- **Name:** `Team [number] - [team name]`
- **Application Type:** Drupal 11
- **Source Code:** GitHub
- **GitHub Account:** Link your account by logging in
- **Repository:**
  - Use existing repository
  - Select your fork from Step 2
  - Select the `master` branch

You should now be able to deploy the `master` branch.

### 4. Configuring the Development Website

Steps:

1. From the **Application Summary** page, click **Open Application** to access the Dev Environment (browser VS Code).
2. Copy the displayed password — you will need it to access the environment.
3. In browser VS Code open a terminal window.
4. Run the following commands to initialize the Drupal website:

```shell
composer install
drush -y si --existing-config --db-url="${DB_DRIVER}://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}"
```

Remember to set up the amazee.io AI provider on the site since its configuration is ignored, [see section above](#amazeeio-ai-provider-setup).

## Resources

While not included in this distribution, the following modules may be useful resources to explore during the hackathon
if they align with your project goals:

- [FlowDrop UI Agents](https://www.drupal.org/project/flowdrop_ui_agents): A visual agent builder that greatly improves
  the development experience for creating AI-powered agents.
- [Tool API](https://www.drupal.org/project/tool_api): A module that allows you to define and manage tools that can be
  used by AI agents to perform specific tasks. This represents a more integrated approach for agents to interact with tools.
- [Agent Handler](https://www.drupal.org/project/ai_agent_agent): When combined with FlowDrop UI for agents, this provides
  an AI agent that can create and edit agents and explain available tools. You can attach it to a chatbot to get assistance
  with agents and tools.
- [Pexels AI](https://www.drupal.org/project/pexels_ai): Integrates the Pexels API to provide AI-powered image search
  and download capabilities.
